```
to comple it copy paste this in a file named hello_world.sr. then compile it with following command:
```
python compiler.py soroush.sr soroush.o
```
then we use ld linker to create executable file
```
ld -m elf_i386 -o hello_world hello_world.o
```
now we can run our program 
```
$ ./hello_world 
Hello world!
```
## Decompiling your code to soroush
You may have a project that you wrote in another language but you wish you wrote it in soroush instead. don't worry because soroush allows you to decompile your program to soroush. then you can recompile it again
```
python decompiler.py my_prog > my_prog.sr
```
## it's not limited to executable files
you can decompile any file to soroush language. even if it's not executable
```
python decompiler.py my_resume.pdf > my_resume.sr
```
